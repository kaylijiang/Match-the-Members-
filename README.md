# Match-the-Members-
Match the Members is an IOS app intending to help new MDB members familiarize themselves with all members within the club. The app works by giving the user five seconds to see an image of a member and choose the correct name of that member among four choices. For every correct choice, the score goes up by one. There is an added pause button in case the user needs to leave, but it blurs the image and answer choices to prevent an unfair time extension

Each round will consist of this setup with a changing image:

Upon hitting pause, the user will see a blank image and button names to prevent unfair time limits:
